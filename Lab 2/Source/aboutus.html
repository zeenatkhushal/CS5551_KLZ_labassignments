<h1> About Us </h1> <hr><br>
<h5>Augmented reality is the composition of computer data with the real time data environment. Big data is the technique used to handle large amount of heterogeneous data. Deep Learning is an innovative technology in Machine learning used for representation of data by predicting results. The deep learning works on the problem having pixels of data, audio recognition and text data. 

A large scale of computations is required to apply Machine Learning Techniques on Mobile application. This provides a base for the advertising company to process real time audio on the products available in the cloud database. An intelligent hearing system which can recognize the audio based on deep learning techniques through database and mobile phone.  A mobile application is required to pick the product from the existing database based on the voice data from the user/client and apply sound in real time on the augmented reality advertisements and amplify the sound intelligently according to the listener.</h5>	<hr>
